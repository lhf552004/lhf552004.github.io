## Auto Backup
Some references or documents I hope to keep locally,At meantime, I also want to backup it to network to avoid to miss them <br/>
The question is I couldn't backup every time when there is some changing. So I make a small tool to solve this problem. <br/>
You can set a list of source folders and related target folders. The application will sync the source folder to target folder.<br/>
After it is running, it will hide and run as a tray.<br/>
Caution: If you delete the file or subfolder, it will delete at target folder.<br/>

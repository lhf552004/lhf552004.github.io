## Install
To use MongoDB in python, you should install the driver package 'pymongo'

### Description
Before installing the package 'pymongo', you should confirm you have installed the python installing tool.
For example, 'pip', 'easy_install'. I use pip.
To install pip, download 'get-pip.py'
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
and run the file:
python get-pip.py

pip install pymongo
